# Design notes

Read this before making non-trivial changes. It captures the *why* behind
choices that aren't obvious from the code, and warns about gotchas that have
already burned us once.

## What this is

A Svelte 5 SPA that reimplements Treeherder Perfherder's "Add series" dialog
with one big flat list instead of a harness → platform → suite drill-down.
The user types free text and clicks badges; the list narrows.

The whole app is client-side. Signatures are fetched directly from
`treeherder.mozilla.org` — its API has `access-control-allow-origin: *`, so
we don't need a backend proxy. **If Mozilla ever tightens CORS, this
architecture breaks.**

## Architecture

- [src/lib/api.ts](../src/lib/api.ts) — types, network calls, `toSeries`
  (raw signature → enriched `Series`). Framework map + option-collection map
  are fetched once and passed in. `toSeries` bakes `Series.key`
  (`${repo}|${signatureHash}`) and `Series.parentKey` in at construction,
  so callers never recompose the compound identity — using
  `signatureHash` alone would collide across repos.
- [src/lib/filter.ts](../src/lib/filter.ts) — **pure logic**. Filter
  model (chips + free text), `matchesRow`, sort comparator, cache-key +
  fallback picker, child grouping. Unit-tested.
- [src/lib/pickerState.svelte.ts](../src/lib/pickerState.svelte.ts) — the
  reactive core of the picker: a `PickerState` class holding every
  `$state` cell, the `$derived` graph, the `$effect` that triggers
  fetches, and the mutation methods. No template code lives here, so
  every seam is exercisable without a DOM.
- [src/lib/FilterInput.svelte](../src/lib/FilterInput.svelte) — the chip +
  text input widget. Owns its in-progress text value; publishes committed
  chips + residual text upward via `onchange`.
- [src/lib/AddSeriesPicker.svelte](../src/lib/AddSeriesPicker.svelte) —
  a thin renderer over `PickerState`. Instantiates the class and wires
  DOM events to its methods; adds no reactive state of its own.
- [src/App.svelte](../src/App.svelte) — thin host.

**State ownership rule.** All shared UI state (filter, sort, cache,
selection, expansion) lives on the `PickerState` instance created by
`AddSeriesPicker.svelte`. `FilterInput.svelte` is dumb — the only local
state it has is the in-progress `textValue`, so mid-typing parses
don't round-trip through the parent on every keystroke.

## Data flow

```
User controls                              Fetch state
─────────────                              ───────────
selectedRepos     ─┐          seriesCache: Map<key, Series[]>
timeRangeSeconds  ─┼→ $effect ─→ loadRepo() per missing key
includeSubtests   ─┘             key = "repo|subtests|interval"

Rendering pipeline
──────────────────
combined      = union of pickCachedForRepo(cache, repo, interval) for repo in selectedRepos
                (prefers subtests=1 cache; falls back to subtests=0)
                ↓
filteredParents = combined.filter(!isSubtest && matchesRow(row, filter))
                          .sort(compareRows(_, _, sort))
                ↓
flatRows       = parents ⊕ (expanded parents' children / notes) — a flat list
                 the virtual scroller windows into.
```

## Key design decisions

### One big fetch instead of dropdown-driven fetches

Perfherder makes you pick framework → repo → platform before showing any
tests. This wastes clicks when you already know the suite name and don't
care about the harness. Measured fetch numbers (14-day interval):

| Repo | no subtests | with subtests |
|---|---|---|
| autoland | 4.1 MB / 0.3 s | 12.2 MB / 0.8 s |
| mozilla-central | 5.3 MB / 0.5 s | 18.7 MB / 1.0 s |
| mozilla-beta | 2.7 MB / 0.3 s | 5.6 MB / 0.5 s |
| try | 6.9 MB / 0.6 s | 22.6 MB / 0.9 s |

Default view (central + autoland, no subtests) is ~9 MB / ~0.5 s parallel.
Fetches are cheap enough that this approach is viable. **If the API ever
gets much slower or larger, revisit this trade-off.**

### Cache key: `repo|subtests|interval`, with a fallback preference

The cache is keyed by the tuple that identifies a distinct API response.
Toggling "Match inside subtests" naively switches the lookup key and would
blank the list until the fatter response arrives. Fix, in
[filter.ts::pickCachedForRepo](../src/lib/filter.ts): **prefer the
subtests=1 cache if loaded; fall back to subtests=0.** This is safe because
a subtests=1 fetch is a strict superset of subtests=0 — the top-level rows
are identical in both. Do not break this invariant without also revisiting
the disclosure UX.

### Row identity: `Series.key`, composed at construction

`Series.key` = `${repository}|${id}`, populated in
[api.ts::toSeries](../src/lib/api.ts). It's used anywhere a row needs
stable per-row identity across the union of caches — expansion state,
parent-child grouping, master-checkbox scope, and the `#each` key in
[AddSeriesPicker.svelte](../src/lib/AddSeriesPicker.svelte)'s virtual
scroller. Subtest rows also carry `Series.parentKey` (their parent's
`key`), so [filter.ts::groupChildrenByParent](../src/lib/filter.ts) can
bucket children without repeating the compound-key recipe.

**Signature-hash aliasing (two failure modes we've been burned by).**
`signature_hash` is *not* a globally unique identifier — the picker used
to key rows by `${repository}|${signatureHash}`, and both of these bit us:

1. **Across repos.** The same test has the same hash on autoland and
   mozilla-central. Keying by hash alone lets autoland children get
   attached to a mozilla-central parent (and vice versa). Fixed once by
   including the repo in the key.
2. **Within a repo, across `application`.** Two rows that differ *only*
   by application (custom-car vs chrome for the same suite/platform)
   share a hash — apparently `application` is not part of the hash
   input. `${repo}|${hash}` still collides, and
   `groupChildrenByParent` then merges children across applications; the
   virtual `#each` throws `each_key_duplicate` when both parents are on
   screen and expanded.

Fix: **key by the API's row `id`**, which is per-signature and globally
unique in the treeherder DB. `parentKey` can no longer be constructed
from the raw `parent_signature` (also a hash — same aliasing) — the
[toSeries](../src/lib/api.ts) pass builds a lookup from
`(hash, application) → parentId` and stores `parentKey =
${repo}|${parentId}` on each child. The assumption is that a child
inherits its parent's `application`, which holds in every sample we've
checked; a warning-worthy fallback would be to leave `parentKey` null
and render the child as an orphan, but we've not needed it.

Consequences for anyone touching this code:

- **Never key rows by `signatureHash` alone.** Not in maps, not in
  `#each` blocks, not in cache lookups. Use `Series.key`.
- **Never derive `parentKey` from `parent_signature` directly.** Go
  through the parent's `Series.key` — that's the whole point of the
  field.
- **If you invent a new lookup keyed by `(repo, hash)`,** convince
  yourself the collision doesn't matter (or add the disambiguator).

### "Match inside subtests" is a filter semantic; fetching is separate

`matchSubtests` (the checkbox on the filter row) means one thing: when
on AND the filter is active, a parent qualifies if it OR any of its
children match. Parents that only match via a child are auto-expanded,
and under any expanded parent only the matched children are rendered
(see `PickerState.childrenForParent` /
[filter.ts::matchParentWithChildren](../src/lib/filter.ts)).

Whether we actually *fetch* the fatter subtests=1 payload is a
different, derived question. `PickerState.needSubtestsFetch` returns
true when `matchSubtests` is on OR any row has been manually expanded —
either case makes child rows part of what's visible on screen. Manual
expansion no longer flips `matchSubtests`, so expanding one row can't
silently rearrange the whole filtered list.

Why the split: with the old "include subtests" toggle, clicking a
subtest badge added a `test:<name>` chip that no parent could satisfy
(parent rows have an empty `test` field), so the list went empty.
Descending the filter into subtests fixes that, and auto-expansion
makes the *reason* a parent survived visible. Coupling that filter
semantic to the fetch trigger, and coupling the fetch trigger to
manual expansion, made cause and effect impossible to reason about.
Do not conflate `matchSubtests=false` with "hide subtests" — subtests
are still visible under manually expanded parents in that mode; the
flag only means "the filter does not descend."

### Framework is searchable but not shown

Perfherder cares deeply about `framework` (talos vs browsertime vs awsy).
Users of this tool don't. The framework name is:
- **Not** shown as a column, chip filter, or dropdown.
- **Included** in `row.searchText` so typing "browsertime" as free text
  still narrows correctly.
- Available via `row.frameworkId` / `row.framework` if you need to
  reintroduce it later.

### Structured filter model: chips + free text

`Filter = { chips: FilterChip[], text: string }`. Each chip is a strict
`(field, value)` equality; each free-text token is a substring match against
`row.searchText`. Rules:

- Chips of the **same field OR** together (`repo:autoland repo:mozilla-central`
  is a whitelist).
- Chips of **different fields AND** together.
- Free-text tokens are all ANDed on top.
- Empty filter = wildcard.

Chip values are stored **lowercase** so equality is stable regardless of
how a badge happened to be cased. Only known field names (`suite`, `test`,
`application`, `repo`, `platform`, `option`) become chips. Everything else
stays as free text (typos are visible, not silently swallowed).

**We used to expose a `tag:` field.** Per the Perfherder data model
cheat sheet below, `tags` is a subset of `extra_options` whose membership
reflects historical harness wiring, not a semantic distinction the user
should reason about. A `tag:webrender` chip would silently omit rows
where webrender is an option but not a tag — same string, arbitrary
partition. The `option:` field is a strict superset and is what users
actually want; the `tag:` chip was removed.

### Every badge in the table is a filter toggle

A badge's click adds the corresponding chip; if the chip already exists,
click removes it. Visual affordance: hover shows a `+` cue; active shows a
`×` cue and a blue outline. Badge is a `<button>`, not a `<span>` — full
keyboard support falls out of that. `title` attributes describe the action
for screen readers and hover-hint.

### Layout stability

Several places take care to not shift the list under the user's cursor:

- Repo chips: the count slot has `min-width: 4.5em` so toggling the
  checkbox — or seeing "loading…" become "7,680" — doesn't reflow the row.
- Action buttons: Clear/Add stay mounted (disabled when nothing is picked)
  so the very first checkbox click doesn't push the table down 30px.
- `picked-count` has `min-width: 9ch` so "0 selected" → "12 selected"
  doesn't nudge the buttons horizontally.

**When adding new UI, budget for the "loading" and "empty" states so they
occupy the same space as the "loaded" state.** This is the single biggest
polish issue in dashboards, and we've paid the tax already.

### Whitespace between adjacent badges (Svelte gotcha)

Svelte's compiler strips whitespace between adjacent template elements. A
naive `{#each opts as o}<span class="badge">{o}</span> {/each}` produces
"optfission" when the user copy-pastes. **Always insert `{' '}` explicitly:**

```svelte
{#each opts as o}<span class="badge">{o}</span>{' '}{/each}
```

The current code uses `{@render badge(field, value, cls)}{' '}` for the same
reason.

### Virtual scrolling over a flat row list

Broad filters can match 25k parents; expanding one parent adds ~200
subtests. Rendering all of that into the DOM tanks scroll perf.

[AddSeriesPicker.svelte](../src/lib/AddSeriesPicker.svelte) flattens
`filteredParents` (plus each expanded parent's children or its
loading/empty note) into a single `flatRows` array, then renders only the
window `[startIndex, endIndex)` — driven by the `.table-wrap` scroller's
`scrollTop` and `clientHeight`. Two spacer `<tr>` elements before and
after the visible window occupy the space the un-rendered rows would.

Row heights are **exact**, not estimated. The multi-badge cells
(Suite/Test and Options) apply `white-space: nowrap` so their content
never wraps to a second line, which pins every parent and child row to
`ROW_HEIGHT = 36`. That means `scrollTop / ROW_HEIGHT` is an accurate
index and `startIndex * ROW_HEIGHT` is where the first rendered row
actually sits — no drift as you scroll. If you add a new column, keep it
one-line-tall too, or the picker starts jittering again. Subtest-note
rows are shorter than 36px (a minor exception; they're rare enough that
it doesn't compound).

**Do not rename the picker instance back to `state`.** `const state = new
PickerState()` inside a `.svelte` file collides with the `$state` rune:
the compiler interprets `$state(...)` calls as store subscriptions on a
variable literally named `state` and fails at runtime with
`store_invalid_shape`. The convention in this file is `picker`.

## Testing

- **Pure logic** (`filter.ts`, parts of `api.ts`): vitest, no DOM. Run with
  `npm test`. This is where new invariants should be pinned.
- **UI flows**: no committed component tests. During development, I've been
  running a throwaway puppeteer smoke script (`smoke.mjs`) that types into
  the filter, clicks badges, checks headers. It's not in the repo because
  puppeteer downloads a ~200 MB Chromium and CI doesn't need it. If you
  need to reproduce the pattern, `npm install --save-dev puppeteer`, write
  the script, run it against `npm run dev`, then remove.
- Every commit runs `npx svelte-check` cleanly and `npm run build` cleanly.
  Keep both green.

## Perfherder data model, cheat sheet

The Treeherder signatures endpoint returns a `{ id: signature }` object.
Each signature has:

- `signature_hash`, `framework_id`, `option_collection_hash`, `machine_platform`
- `suite`, `test` (subtest name; often unset for parents)
- `application` — browser variant: firefox / fenix / chrome / cstm-car-m /
  safari / etc. **Not** the framework.
- `extra_options` — kitchen-sink list: opt, fission, webrender, nova, e10s,
  stylo, …
- `tags` — a *subset* of extra_options that the perftest harness chose to
  promote. `fission` and `webrender` are always tags because they're
  globally appended in raptor/results.py; `nova` isn't a tag because it's
  added by a per-test support class. **We ignore this field entirely** —
  the picker treats every extra_option uniformly. Don't reintroduce a
  distinction: tag membership reflects when things were wired up, not
  what they are.
- `has_subtests`, `parent_signature` — parent/child link between rows.
  Fetched only when `subtests=1`.
- `measurement_unit`, `should_alert`, `lower_is_better`

### The `machine_platform` string is not just hardware

`machine_platform` values like `macosx1500-aarch64-shippable` or
`windows11-64-24h2-nightlyasrelease` include build-variant suffixes that
you might expect to be options. They're baked into the string because
Taskcluster treats "shippable" and "nightlyasrelease" as distinct build
identities (they produce different binaries), and `platform` is the key
used to look up the build. See mozilla-central
`taskcluster/test_configs/test-platforms.yml`. **Don't parse or reformat
these strings for display — you'll get bitten by edge cases.**

## Things I'd change next

### Features

- Persist the filter and sort in the URL query so the picker is
  shareable. `filter=...&sort=platform:desc` etc.
- Column reordering + hide/show. Not worth it until someone asks.
- Auto-complete inside the FilterInput (suggest values for `repo:` etc).
- Actually plot the selected series on a graph — this is currently just
  the picker.

### Refactors

- **Component decomposition, cautiously.** A `PickerRow.svelte` that owns
  a single row's expand/select/badge interactions would shrink the main
  file, but Svelte 5 reactive tracking across component boundaries can
  make snappy interactions surprisingly re-render-heavy. Only pull this
  trigger if we hit perf issues, and profile before/after.
